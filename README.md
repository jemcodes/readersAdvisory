### Project Details
>‚ÄúWe read books to find out who we are. What other people, real or imaginary, do and think and feel... is an essential guide to our understanding of what we ourselves are and may become.‚Äù
‚Äï Ursula K. LeGuin

My Readers' Advisory Full-Stack Project aims to unite readers with books they'll love. One-part subscription box service, one-part blind date with a book, topped with a little library science and served up fresh, just for you!

### Visit Readers' Advisory

### Feature Spotlight
* Readers can create, read, update, and delete book preferences. 
* Readers can also create, read, update, and delete subscriptions.
* When a reader is done with the service, they can delete their account and moved on - no strings attached. **(Currently only available for non-Demo user to preserve Demo experience)**
* Advisors can view a simple dashboard listing the readers assigned to them.

### Challenges
One of the biggest challenges I faced with this project was implementing two separate login paths for two different types of users. Because I want my Advisors to be able to put together orders specifically based on their Advisees' preferences, I needed to protect that information for the right eyes only.

Having only ever worked with authorizing and authenticating a single type of user, I had to do my research! I created separate role types and wrote dedicated routes for each to grant the appropriate permissions to the correct users.

### Code Snippets
*Examples from advisor authorization and authentication work:*

*Complex Query to get a list of Readers assigned to an Advisor and to include access to each Reader's preferences:*

### Meet The Dev

Hiya, I'm jane! üëã

Programming brings together my passions for building, creating, and problem-solving. Before coming to the coding world, I worked several lifetimes' worth of creative and analytical careers, from founding and managing companies to voiceover work to digging deep into disability law - and almost everything else in between. As a multipotentialite, I'm thrilled to see where this programming journey takes me!

You can find me right here on [Github](https://github.com/jemcodes) or over on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jemcodes/)
